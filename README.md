### Well-rounded with a love of data
Iâ€™m a full stack engineer with a focus on data and a broad range of experience. I am able to build robust systems that effectively collect and clean data.

I have worked at enterprise scale for three years, and have worked in a variety of roles including application development, devops, and quality. The deployment tool I maintained and improved has performed over 1 million deployments within the company, and I know that because I built the data collection infrastructure for it.

Iâ€™ve lived on 3 continents and speak four languages. When Iâ€™m not working, I love traveling, cooking new foods, learning languages, and automating everything possible in my house.

I'm currently working on [foreign-language-reader](https://github.com/foreign-language-reader), a webapp built to help people learn languages by automating the work needed to create a learning environment.

Want to know more? Feel free to send me an email or browse some of my projects. I'd love to collaborate on something open-source.
